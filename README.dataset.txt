This model is intended to classify tracks of game and fur mammals that are found in Maryland. The model classifies tracks by family-level taxonomy as opposed by species, and currently identifies the following taxonomic groups: ursidae, cervidae, felidae, canidae, mustelidae. Each class is intended to be made up of around 140-150 samples, and images are pulled from research grade samples from this iNaturalist project: https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/north-american-animal-tracks-database
This model was created for a class assignment in AI and Natural History at St. Maryâ€™s College of Maryland.
